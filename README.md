# Guess the button
### This is a version with N buttons.
In this project we have a input number and a button to generate the desired number of buttons, of which only one is the winner. It is chosen randomly. Once you have chosen a button a message will be displayed if it is the winner or not. And another restart button will be displayed (in case you want to try again).
